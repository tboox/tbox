/*! the bloom filter type
 *
 * A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, 
 * conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. 
 * False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not; 
 * i.e. a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". 
 * Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a "counting" filter). 
 * The more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives.
 *
 * Assume that a hash function selects each array position with equal probability. 
 * If m is the number of bits in the array, and k is the number of hash functions, 
 * then the probability that a certain bit is not set to 1 by a certain hash function 
 * during the insertion of an element is then
 * 1 - 1 / m
 *
 * The probability that it is not set to 1 by any of the hash functions is
 * (1 - 1/ m) ^ k
 *
 * If we have inserted n elements, the probability that a certain bit is still 0 is
 * (1 - 1/ m) ^ kn
 *
 * the probability that it is 1 is therefore
 * 1 - ((1 - 1/ m) ^ kn)
 *
 * Now test membership of an element that is not in the set.
 * Each of the k array positions computed by the hash functions is 1 with a probability as above.
 * The probability of all of them being 1, 
 * which would cause the algorithm to erroneously claim that the element is in the set, is often given as
 * p = (1 - ((1 - 1/ m) ^ kn))^k ~= (1 - e^(-kn/m))^k
 *
 * For a given m and n, the value of k (the number of hash functions) that minimizes the probability is
 * k = (m / n) * ln2 ~= (m / n) * (9 / 13)
 *
 * which gives
 * 2 ^ -k ~= 0.6185 ^ (m / n)
 *
 * The required number of bits m, given n (the number of inserted elements) 
 * and a desired false positive probability p (and assuming the optimal value of k is used) 
 * can be computed by substituting the optimal value of k in the probability expression above:
 * p = (1 - e ^-(m/nln2)n/m))^(m/nln2)
 *
 * which can be simplified to:
 * lnp = -m/n * (ln2)^2
 *
 * This optimal results in:
 * s = m/n = -lnp / (ln2 * ln2) = -log2(p) / ln2
 * k = s * ln2 = -log2(p) <= note: this k will be larger
 *
 * compute s(m/n) for given k and p:
 * p = (1 - e^(-kn/m))^k = (1 - e^(-k/s))^k
 * => lnp = k * ln(1 - e^(-k/s))
 * => (lnp) / k = ln(1 - e^(-k/s))
 * => e^((lnp) / k) = 1 - e^(-k/s)
 * => e^(-k/s) = 1 - e^((lnp) / k) = 1 - (e^lnp)^(1/k) = 1 - p^(1/k)
 * => -k/s = ln(1 - p^(1/k))
 * => s = -k / ln(1 - p^(1/k)) and define c = p^(1/k)
 * => s = -k / ln(1 - c)) and ln(1 + x) ~= x - 0.5x^2 while x < 1 
 * => s ~= -k / (-c-0.5c^2) = 2k / (2c + c * c)
 *
 * so 
 * c = p^(1/k)
 * s = m / n = 2k / (2c + c * c)
